/**
Functions in this module can be used from both C and D. To use them from C, 
include pfft.h. Only the functions that operate on floats are listed here. To
calculate fft of doubles or reals (long doubles in C), just replace the "_f"
suffix on functions and "F" on types with "_d" or "_l" on functions and "D" or 
"L" on types. 

Example of using this module from C:
---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pfft.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int n = atoi(argv[1]);
    PfftTableF tab = pfft_table_f(n, 0);
    float *re = pfft_allocate_f(n);
    float *im = pfft_allocate_f(n);
    
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%f %f", re + i, im + i);

    pfft_fft_f(re, im, tab);
       
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        printf("%f %f\n", re[i], im[i]);

    pfft_free_f(re);
    pfft_free_f(im);
    pfft_table_free_f(tab);
}

/**
Calculates discrete fourier transform of the real valued sequence in data. 
The method operates in place. When the method completes, data contains the
result. First $(I n / 2 + 1) elements contain the real part of the result and 
the rest contains the imaginary part. Imaginary parts at position 0 and 
$(I n / 2) are known to be equal to 0 and are not stored, so the content of 
data looks like this: 

 $(D r(0), r(1), ... r(n / 2), i(1), i(2), ... i(n / 2 - 1))  


The elements of the result at position greater than $(I n / 2) can be trivially 
calculated from the relation $(I DFT(f)[i] = DFT(f)[n - i]*) that holds 
because the input sequence is real. 


The length of the array must be equal to n and the array must be properly
